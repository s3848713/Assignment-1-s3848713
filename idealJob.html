            This job advertisement is for the cybersecurity analyst. The role of it is to plan and carry out security measures to protect the company’s 
            information networks and computer systems. The key role of this position is to monitor any security threat to the organization’s networks. 
            The demand for a cybersecurity analyst is increasing in the industry as the world becomes increasingly digitized and reliant on technology. 
            Cyberattacks are also becoming more frequent, even the smaller business can’t ignore their networks without security. One of the most appealing
            facts about this role is the growth and, in the future, there will be high demand for this role. 
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            As a cybersecurity analyst, there are many attributes and skills required to perform job duties. This includes exceptional communication and 
            collaboration skills to perform duties and to engage with key stakeholders. This position requires a minimum of a bachelor’s degree in information 
            technology but in most cases, the employer asked for some level of experience. Moreover, to be experts in this field certification are needed such as 
            Certified Information Systems Security Professional (CISSP), Certified Ethical Hacker (CEH), and Certified Information Security Manager (CISM).
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            Firstly, I will have to develop good skills in programming. However, I am just a beginner in this field. I know very little about cybersecurity and how to prevent it.
             I can currently write a code using java, python, and SQL and have some leadership experience.  However, I do not nearly have enough qualifications 
             and experience to apply for this role.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            My plan to qualify for this position is to complete my bachelor’s degree with a higher GPA and focusing more on working as a group as this field requires good teammates.
             Alongside my bachelor’s degree, I am also studying certificate IV in cybersecurity which is an initial step to achieve my goal and, I am looking 
             forward to gaining knowledge through related online courses. Once I complete both degrees, I will try to find my career-related job so I can build 
             my resume and gain some necessary experience in the industry and I am also thinking to study <a href="https://www.rmit.edu.au/study-with-us/levels-of-study/postgraduate-study/masters-by-coursework/master-of-cyber-security-mc159" target="_blank">mater in cybersecurity</a> at RMIT after graduating from my 
             current degree.
