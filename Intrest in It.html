        <h1>What is your interest in IT? </h1>
        
        <p>My interest in IT began from very young age as it runs into the family,
            from my uncles to cousins and interestingly we all three-brother studying
            IT related degree at RMIT. In high school, I also studied IT related subject
            as I already planned to study Bachelor of Information Technology in university.
            One of the most fascinating fact of career in IT is that you are not limited to few
            options as there are vast number of career opportunities in the industry. I am
            enthusiastic to find out how an app or a game works in the background, and sometimes I
            questioned myself, what was the programmer mindset while coding this app or a game.
            Apart from this, I am looking forward to starting my career in cyber security as I really
            like hacking and it’s also one of the most growing field right now. To gain the required knowledge
            and experience I am also studying Certificate IV in cyber security.

        <h1>Why did you choose to come to RMIT?</h1>
        <p>
            I moved to Australia in 2016 and started high school as a year 12 student. I was really'
             struggling that time as I was new to the country and new to the language. That time I had
              chat with one of my teacher about my career who recommended me to go back to year 11 if I want to go to university.
               He also recommended me to visit city campus of RMIT so I can see how good it to study in heart of Melbourne is.
                Luckily, there was a school excursion to the campus and that time he showed me the campus and the city. 
                I was very impressed with the buildings and the community. Moreover, I also researched top universities 
                of Australia and RMIT is one of them according to QS ranking. The university is internationally recognized 
                and offer wide range of courses. Furthermore, there is the option to study some of the subject in other countries. 
                I am really looking forward to exploring other countries during my degree. As I am now a student of RMIT, I don’t 
                regret my decision to spend one more year in high school and I respect that teacher to recommending me best possible 
                option that time.

        <h1>What do you expect to learn during your studies?</h1>
        <p>
            Through my university experience until now, I have learned university is all about managing your own time as there are no one 
            to remind you everyday that assignment is due next week. I would also like to be professional in term of presenting myself and my work, 
            so it can help me in my career. In term of course, I would love to gain programming knowledge and to learn something from which I can create
             an app from which I can help mankind.
