        <h3>What do the results of these tests mean for you?</h3>
        <p>
            The purpose of this test to measure how well I will perform in different tasks. 
            The main aim for this test to understand myself and as the Myer-Briggs test suggest my strategy should be constant improvement. 
            The tests describe me as being prospect to explore new ideas and creative ways of doing things, also being a tactile learner. 
            This means that I learn more effectively by doing things and being hands-on, tending to learn better when some type of physical 
            activity is involved, rather than just reading or hearing information. The result of IPIP Big Five Factor Marker analysed me high 
            in agreeable which means I am friendly and optimistic. Similarly, this test also gives me high marks in intellect/imagination which
             means I am open to experiences. 
            These tests will be helpful in deciding how to study for the exam and for preparing for new adventures in life.
        </p>

        <h3>
            How do you think these results may influence your behaviour in a team?
        </h3>
        <p>
            These tests suggest me to be good at learning so I can help my team to achieve good marks. The Myer-Briggs test suggested that I have feelings 
            for other and that makes me a great team player as sometimes everyone can have a bad day. 
            Whereas, I will take these tests in an account to further improve myself and to perform better in some tasks which I couldnâ€™t achieve in past.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h3>
            How should you take this into account when forming a team?
        </h3>
        <p>
            I will not take this test in an account before forming a team as everyone has few drawbacks and some qualities. 
            Nobody is perfect but its our duty to help other so they can improve themselves. Furthermore, when forming a team, I would like to 
            meet people from different culture with different experiences so I can see how I am different to others. Moreover, If I consider this test results, 
            I want to form a team with people whose test results are completely opposite from me so we can perform tasks in high standards.
