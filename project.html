        <h3>App Name: MySports</h3>
        <br>
        <h3>Overview:</h3>
        <p>
            The project idea that I have is “MySports” which is an app. This app help tennis enthusiastic who are
            looking
            for nearby tennis court. The purpose of this app is to check if the tennis court is currently occupied or
            free.
            The user will able to find other tennis player and coaches to help them to improve their game. This app also
            provides
            users about the latest tennis news, games result, tutorial videos, tennis records and upcoming tournaments
            and matches.
            This app is designed for people who love tennis.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h3>Motivation: </h3>
        <p>
            This app will be interesting because according to universal tennis, Australia is ranked among top 10
            countries. This sport is one of the most played sport around the word and its popularity is increasing. This
            app will also able to find talent in Australia as at the end of the game users have to enter the game result
            and the player will be ranked according to their region. The users of this app also able to buy equipment
            related to tennis in fair price and currently there are few similar app in the market right now which makes
            this project interesting and worth investigating.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h3>Description: </h3>
        <p>
            MySports is an app which helps individuals to find tennis players. When initially user download this app,
            they must register themselves with facebook, google or by providing details of their name, location, age and
            about their tennis skills. This app will take this detail to help them to find nearby tennis courts and
            tennis player who live nearby and has same skill level. It will also classify each court in a detailed
            description, by type of court, whether the court is indoor or outdoor, it is clay court, hard court, grass
            court or a carpet court. This app will notify the user by the permission of other user that they are
            currently at this court.
            <br>
            Another feature of this app could be the direction towards the court so the user can reach to the
            destination without any problem. This app also provides users about the latest stories related to tennis.
            The user will also able to check current match scores, games result, highlights, upcoming tournaments and
            matches. The important part of this app would be that the user will able to find the coach who can help them
            to improve their game. Furthermore, it will also include tutorial videos, tennis records and weekly tips to
            improve game.
            <br>
            Also, a feature that would help tennis player is an online shop in the app from where user will be able to
            buy tennis equipment from verified stores. This feature allow user to find equipment and compare it with
            other markets. The user will also able to schedule a match and add a reminder of it. The group of players
            can easily organize a tournament by just providing the names of player and the app will automatically create
            a schedule for the players.
            <br>
            To attract greater audience toward this app we can add other sports as well because there is a possibility
            that a single player can play multiple sports. Instead of the user find other alternative app for other
            sports why not attract the user to MySports.
            <br>
            The dashboard of the app includes find nearby courts or to find a player. Furthermore, it will also include
            the list of favourite courts which are the courts favourited by the user from which they can quickly look up
            to see if it is free or any friends near them

        </p>
        <br>
        <h3>Tools and Technologies:</h3>
        <p>
            There are a lot of open source tools and software are required to develop this app. The main element needed
            to create MySports are API to co connect app to the server. Furthermore, its design should be user friendly
            so the app would be easy to use. Before creating an actual app, a working prototype is also required which
            can be tested and help us to improve the actual app. Programming language required for building the app
            includes JavaScript, Python, HTML5, and AWS Mobile platform to build and test apps
        </p>
        <br>
        <h3>Skills Required:</h3>
        <p>
            In order to successfully create this app, I would need a strong understand of programming language which
            includes JavaScript, Python, HTML5. The app should be made for the users of both operating system that is
            IOS and android. For that I need a knowledge of many coding languages as the both operating systems uses
            different languages. The app would need to be easy to use and for that an experience team is required as for
            an individual it would be difficult to code and time consuming as well.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h3>Outcome:</h3>
        <p>
            The outcome of this app to encourage millions of tennis player to find other players in their nearby
            suburbs. This app gives them a better experience in world of tennis. The user will also able to check if the
            tennis court is currently occupied or free which can surely save the time of many of the users. Furthermore,
            if the app is successful it can be updated for other sports as well which will help sports community to find
            new players in this busy world.
